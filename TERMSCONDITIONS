***** Terms and Conditions *****


We (Emanuele Delirio and Francesca Gallinelli) built the Tappy app as a free app. This app is provided by us at no cost and is intended for use as is.
Tappy is an app to get visibility of your social media accounts by gaining points (chicks). 
When you gain points, your profile will appear in the Rank section of the app, so that other people can see your profile and,
if they like it, follow you. You will rank higher the more points you earn. 

You can promote your Instagram, TiKTok, Youtube or Twitter accounts, one at time. You just need to add your username. Note that if you
log out of Tappy, your score will be reset to zero for the day.
Do not use or promote banned, illegal, racist, violent or offensive keywords or profiles. 

The app and their creators are not responsible for any consequence that may affect your posts, stories, content, account, platform, device, website, yourself or any other person or business after using Tappy.

We, the creators of this app, reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, limit or discontinue any aspect and functionality of Tappy at any time.
You cannot sell, modify, copy or alter in any way the app and its functionalities, nor delegate someone else to do it for you.
The app is not affiliated with Instagram, TikTok, Twitter or Youtube.
